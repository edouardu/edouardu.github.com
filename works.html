<p><strong>IBM Presence Insights</strong> (Ongoing)
<!-- <br>
<em>Product Designer and Researcher</em>
<br>
2014 — 2015 --></p>

<p>A product/platform which will enable people working "on the floor" (in retail, fulfillment centres, museums, airports, etc.) to get a deeper sense of the world around them — PI is comprised of a set of tools people can utilize to weave together physical and digital experiences/systems in an intuitive and beautiful manner. I'm heading up the design of the PI's info–architecture, interaction models, and method of physical–digital infrastructure setup. <a href="https://presenceinsights.ng.bluemix.net/piui/">View the product</a> or <a href="/posts/pi.html">read my ongoing project notes</a>.</p>

<p><strong>IBM Community Radio</strong> (Ongoing)</p>

<p>Co-founded and branded IBM Community Radio, a side–project–turned–platform for critical thought, culture renewal, and good music. Prototyped the initial front–end / user–facing radio player interfaces, co-ordinated formative radio programming, shows, and other related on-air content, and educated folks on how to get up and running quickly on the network. Guerilla advertised the hell out of the first live broadcasts. <a href="https://soundcloud.com/morningsco">I'm archiving my mixes here.</a></p>

<p><strong>IBM RapidApps</strong>
<!-- <br>
<em>Product Designer, Prototyper, and Researcher</em>
<br>
2013 — 2014 --></p>

<p>An idealistic product/platform built to “Democratize the process of application development”. An attempt at empowering (and educating) non-technical people to build applications to solve everyday life/business problems. I designed and utilized “spatially-concrete” interface/interaction models so that abstract software development concepts were made easier to understand, and led the design of RA's Rules/Logic composing interface. Spoiler alert: <span class="spoiler">The product ended up failing</span>. Read a long-form <a href="/posts/ra.html">postmortem</a> on this project.</p>
