<p><strong>IBM RapidApps</strong>
<!-- <br>
<em>Product Designer, Prototyper, and Researcher</em>
<br>
2013 — 2014 --></p>

<p>An idealistic product/platform built to “Democratize the process of application development”. An attempt at empowering (and educating) non-technical people to build applications to solve everyday life/business problems. RapidApps utilized “spatially-concrete” interface design metaphors so that abstract software development concepts were made easier to understand. Spoiler alert: <span class="spoiler">The product ended up failing.</span> <a href="#">View the beta product</a> or read my <a href="/posts/ra.html">postmortem</a>.</p>
