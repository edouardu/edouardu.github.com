'Digital lab, experimental zone, caution about the premises.' :construction:

Nice to see you and glad you could make it. 

Here lies the mess of what makes up the central hub of my digital-experimentation-zone. Although I've broken out my projects structure to rest within seperate repositories, you'll find in this particular repo the core of the site, information regarding me, and other related stuff.

As for myself, I'm a product designer in both the physical and digital domain — previously I've worked on simple medical devices, housewares for OXO, and environmental products for Henkel. Currently I'm building digital tools at IBM for the every-person.

My various projects on github are a public effort to more-deelpy integrate technical foundations of digital design into my toolkit. I never once intended on crafting simple aesthetic sheathes to go over engineered designs. Good Design is Good Engineering.
