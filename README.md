Hi!

This is the source for [labs.edouard.us](http://labs.edouard.us/), which is in turn the staging-area-of-sorts for [edouard.us](https://edouard.us/). Some day these will be seperate entities, but for now, they are the same. This site was built with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/).

If you'd like to view this site locally, or base your own work off of it, proceed with the following in your terminal of choice:

0. Install Gatsby CLI via `npm install --global gatsby-cli`
1. `git clone` this repository
2. `cd` to the cloned directory
3. Type `npm install` or `yarn install` to install any dependencies
4. Type `gatsby develop` to start a development server
4. type <kbd>control</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> to quit the process

Have fun, have a good time.
