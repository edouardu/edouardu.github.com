<p><strong>Ongoing Prototyping</strong>
<br>
<em>Day–to–Day</em>
<br>
2013 — Ongoing</p>

<p>Since the days of using plastics, papers, and frankensteined objects to realize hardware products, I’ve been constantly figuring out ways to cheaply and rapidly build out ideas. Since the recent boom in designers realizing static mockups weren’t cutting it anymore, I’ve been dabbling in all sorts of nascant tools out there and storing the results in this <a href="https://github.com/edouerd/prototyping">Github repository</a>. It’s better than photos.</p>

<p><strong>Practice Sandbox</strong>
<br>
<em>Day–to–Day</em>
<br>
2013 — Ongoing</p>

<p>A crazy thing about sotware is that tools for making it are constantly being improved, made obsolete, forked, and iterated upon. Frameworks and Libraries sprout left and right, and you never really know what's best for what at any given time. This <a href="https://github.com/edouerd/practice">repository</a> is for practicing with these things, and it's always a mess. Proceed with caution!</p>

<p><strong>How 2 Github Pages</strong>
<br>
<em>Simple Tutorial Site</em>
<br>
2015</p>

<p>While I was at IBM, I made it a personal mission to teach designers that Git(hub) was the shit — both the technology and the popular platform. An often repeated question many had was, “How do I make and host web-based prototypes?” This <a href="http://labs.edouard.us/how2pages">website</a> I spun up in less than 2 minutes was the answer I would give, and later attach to a Slack shortcut. Later on, I threw in confetti I stole from David Rudnick's site <a href="http://trance.army/">http://trance.army/</a>. It's good stuff.</p>

<em>Archival Project</em>
<br>
2014 — Ongoing</p>

<p>Sometime in 2014 I got really sick of reblogging already-circulating media back into the void and decided I was going to be a lot more intentional and thoughtful with the visual material I collected across various places on the web. I decided to use <a href="https://github.com/edouerd/reference">Github</a>, <a href="https://github.com/edouerd/reference/releases">Github Releases</a>, and <a href="https://git-lfs.github.com/">Git LFS</a> to maintain a collection of particularly affecting material I come across throughout the year, as well as snippets of my own work process for anyone who cares. I’m scheduling these drops twice a year, during the typical Spring/Summer and Winter/Fall time periods new clothing is showcased — just cuz.</p>

<em>Illustration Projects</em>
<br>
2014 — Ongoing</p>

<p>I'm currently juggling a few illustration projects, all of which I'm versioning and hopefully deploying via Github. <a href="https://github.com/edouerd/picturebook">Picturebook</a> is a series of SVG illustrations I'm open sourcing because why not ¯\<em>(ツ)</em>/¯, <a href="https://github.com/edouerd/levelcap">Level Cap</a> is a narrative series about the fucked-up future–present, and <a href="https://github.com/edouerd/flyers">Flyers</a> is an emphemeral print distribution project inspired by cults and new age pamphlets.</p>

<em>Public Tooling</em>
<br>
2014 — Ongoing</p>

<p>Generally speaking, <a href="https://github.com/edouerd/dotfiles">dotfiles</a> tell you a lot about a person. Right now, the state of my terminal is bleak, but it will get better someday. In general I think it's cool to share tooling, so I keep Sketch <a href="https://github.com/edouerd/sketch">plugins</a> I use public as well.</p>

<p><strong>Résumé</strong>
<br>
<em>Text Adventure Game</em>
<br>
2014</p>

<p>I had an incredibly wacky idea a few years ago to make my website/résumé into an interactive text adventure. The idea was that you'd chat to a fictional version of me and learn about my work/ethos/whatever in a conversational tone. You could enact violence upon me to end the experience. This whole thing was built in <a href="https://twinery.org/">Twine</a> and heavily inspired my one of my biggest inspirations/mentors, <a href="http://auntiepixelante.com/">Anna Anthropy</a>. <a href="http://labs.edouard.us/resume/">Source is here</a>.</p>

<em>Raspberry Pi Installation</em>
<br>
2014</p>

<p>A project inspired by a currently-defunct undertaking by <a href="http://www.rey.sc/">Jefferey Scudder</a>. The original project comprised of 3-ish second long webcam videos taken the same time every day. What resulted was a string of youtube videos depicting life as it passed by in front of a computer. I thought it would be cool to mimic this project with a remotely-controlled Raspberry Pi and camera set to go off at 11am and 11pm every day with a simple cron job script. <a href="https://github.com/edouerd/ss">Right now my project is also defunct</a>, but I plan on reinstating it soon.</p>
