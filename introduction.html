<p>Dude, this site is under construction. Note the "labs" in the URL.</p>

<p>If you're curious how it's going, check in here: <a href="https://github.com/edouuard/edouuard.github.com">https://github.com/edouuard/edouuard.github.com</a></p>

<p>Otherwise, pay this place no mind. It's a mess.</p>

<p>Hi there! — I'm a product designer and prototyper at IBM Design (MobileFirst Platform). </p>

<p>Currently I'm building tools to weave together physical and digital experiences in beautiful ways.</p>

<p>Also,</p>

<p>I tend to my experimental project–studio, Mornings. (products, textbooks, and interventions)</p>

<p>Thanks for Visiting! ( ꒪ͧ⌓꒪ͧ)</p>
