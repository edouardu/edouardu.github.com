Hi, how's it going?

A few days ago I encountered my first (micro) dosage of acid. It was a pleasant experience. Akin to a very strong and euphoric cup of coffee.

I'm currently being paid to imagine what computing might look like in the near future. This work is infinitely more rewarding than the work I'm currently being paid for on a biweekly basis. I'm thinking soon it might be a good idea to switch up my day job.
