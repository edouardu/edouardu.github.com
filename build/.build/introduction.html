<p>Hey — I'm a physical–digital product designer né industrial designer based (soon) in New York City.</p>

<h6>Currently —</h6>

<ol>
<li><p>I'm at <a href="https://www.tumblr.com/">Tumblr</a> building a dazzling array of digital products for millions of creative people <em>and</em></p></li>
<li><p>I'm tending to my experimental project–studio, <a class="mornings" href="http://mornings.co/">Mornings</a> <em>and</em></p></li>
<li><p>I'm self-organizing creative events and schooling at <a class="public-services" href="http://publicservices.co/">Public Services</a> with good friends.</p></li>
</ol>

<h6>Previously —</h6>

<ol>
<li>I was at <a class="old" href="http://www.ibm.com/design/">International Business Machines</a> building many things: A (global) community radio, a <a class="old" href="/posts/pi.html">platform/tool</a> that blurred boundaries between physical space and big data, a <a class="old" href="http://www.ibm.com/design/">prototyping practice</a> non-designers/developers could understand, a democratic <a class="old" href="/posts/ra.html">product</a> doomed to fail, and the <a class="old" href="/posts/vs.html">seed of promise</a> for enabling a 100-year old company to work better, together. It was a lovely time.</li>
</ol>

<p>Thanks for visiting and stay a while. If you want, <a href="mailto:mail@edouard.us">send me a letter</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/edouerd">tweet at me</a>.</p>
