<p>An IoT platform/product that helps people get a deeper sense of their physical space and the individuals moving through it. I'm heading up the design of the PI's info–architecture, interaction models, and physical–digital infrastructure setup. <a href="https://www.ng.bluemix.net/docs/services/presenceinsights/index.html">Check out PI</a> or <a href="/posts/pi.html">read my ongoing project notes</a>.</p>

<p><strong>IBM Community Radio</strong> (Ongoing)</p>

<p>Co-founded and branded IBM Community Radio, a side–project–turned–platform for critical thought, culture renewal, and good music. <a href="http://codepen.io/collection/XKpoxN/">Prototyped</a> the initial front–end player/schedule interfaces, co-ordinated formative on-air content, and educated folks on how to get up and running quickly on the network. Guerilla advertised the hell out of the first live broadcasts. <a href="https://soundcloud.com/morningsco">Archiving my mixes here.</a></p>

<p><strong>IBM RapidApps</strong>
<!-- <br>
<em>Product Designer, Prototyper, and Researcher</em>
<br>
2013 — 2014 --></p>

<p>An idealistic product built to empower and educate non-technical people to build applications using filetypes they knew best. I designed and utilized “spatially-concrete” interface/interaction models to simplify abstract software development concepts and led the design of RA's Rules/Logic composing interface. Spoiler alert: <span class="spoiler">The product ended up failing</span>. Read a long-form <a href="/posts/ra.html">postmortem</a> on this project.</p>
