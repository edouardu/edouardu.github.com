When Alban, Kim, Jennifer, and myself were asked to ‘Redesign Mobility for People in Wheelchairs’, we didn't expect to redesign the act of _urination_.



###### Intro

When you think of having to live out your life in a wheelchair indefinitely, how do you expect it to feel? 

###### Research

We heavily utilized the model of research and insights gathering that was pioneered by IDEO. This process involved deep interaction with our various stakeholders, each of whom had lifetimes worth of experience and knowledge for us to consider and learn from. A huge component of our research was constant evaluation 

One of the first no-brainer tasks for us was to get a hold of wheelchair.

###### Development

There came a time when we had learned more than our collective brains could handle.

###### Engineering
