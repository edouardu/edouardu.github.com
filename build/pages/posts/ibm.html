###### tl;dr —

If you're averse towards long-form exposition, here's a brief listing of products and experiences I've built/contributed to while working at IBM.

1. IBM Presence Insights — Scalable Location Awareness Platform • [app site](http://www-03.ibm.com/software/products/en/ibm-mobilefirst-platform-presence-insights) / [project](/posts/pi.html)
2. IBM RapidApps — Codeless Application Development • [app site](https://developer.ibm.com/rapidapps) / [project](/posts/ra.html)
3. "Virtual Studio" — System(s) for Mass Collaboration
4. IBM Design Language — Self Explanatory • [website](http://www.ibm.com/design/language/framework/experience.shtml)

###### Intro —

It was the summer of 2013, and I had found myself in the lobby of a glass building with 80-or-so strangers. A few months prior, I had decided to jump straight into a 'real-life job' right after university — a job that entailed the design and development of digital products.

Given that, before this summer, I had dedicated four years of my life to the pinpoint focus and study of physical product design, the entire prospect of jumping into software design was pretty terrifying.

I had no idea what I was getting myself into.

###### Initially —

Initially, IBM Design was for all intents and purposes the Wild West.

Without much direction, us first wave designers *needed* to chart out how Design Culture would be established in a company where designers were largely thought of as icon builders. It was explicitly mentioned by Phil Gilbert, our General Manager, that the odds were pretty stacked against us.

This was the environment we were dropped into.

<!-- ###### Processing —

Here I am today, having designed an [application-development platform](https://developer.ibm.com/rapidapps/) for the everyday person, contributed to the structure of a [new design language](http://www.ibm.com/design/language/framework.shtml) for one of the oldest companies around, and sown the seeds for a new interpretation of what remote/virtual collaboration *should* be. -->
