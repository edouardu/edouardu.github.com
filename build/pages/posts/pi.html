At the moment, my job is to take this powerful (and quite ugly) research project —

<img src="{% static '/images/pi-1.png' %}"/>

— and (re)form it into a platform that empowers the people who use it to learn more about the “invisible sysyems in their surrounding environment” in a rich and pragmatic way.

###### As it stands —

Our current description of Presence Insights from a business-value perspective is as such:

> Presence Insights:

> “A Physical–Digital System by which a Brick & Mortar Establishment can Optimise their services/offerings/supply chain and Give tangible value back to their customers.”

Our team is currently undergoing a heavy research phase, but if you'd like to chat about what this project comprises of, I'm only a keystroke away.

###### Currently —

I've been embroiled in learning in ins–and–outs of setting up physical and digital infrastructure so that a sensing mesh network can actually function properly.

I've been tailing and speaking with people representative of the “IT Operations Staff” whom typically find themselves doing the setup work for projects of this kind. It's generally very painful.

I mean, this is what I'm dealing with right now:

<img src="{% static '/images/pi-2.jpg' %}"/>

I have my work cut out for me.

###### More Soon !
