Hey — I'm a physical–digital product designer and prototyper based in Austin, Texas.

###### Here's some more —

1. No-brainer social networking: [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/edouerd), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/edouerd), and [Instagram](https://instagram.com/edouard.u/).

2. [Github](https://github.com/edouerd?tab=repositories) is my favorite design tool and toolkit storage at the moment.

3. [Dribbble](https://dribbble.com/edouard) is alright for posting in-progress work.

4. I'm an aspiring noise and/or pop musician on [Soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/girlhood).

5. I like to [make](http://u-hh.tumblr.com/) / [revisit](http://a-hh.tumblr.com/archive) moodboards and [blog](http://blog.edouard.us/) sporadically on Tumblr.
