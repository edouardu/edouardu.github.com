**IBM Presence Insights**
<!-- <br>
*Product Designer and Researcher*
<br>
2014 — 2015 -->

An IoT platform/product that helps people get a deeper sense of their physical space and the individuals moving through it. I took point on the design of the PI's info–architecture, interaction models, and physical–digital infrastructure setup. [Check out PI](https://www.ng.bluemix.net/docs/services/presenceinsights/index.html) or [read my once-ongoing project notes](/posts/pi.html).

**IBM Community Radio**

Co-founded and branded IBM Community Radio, a side–project–turned–platform for critical thought, culture renewal, and good music. [Prototyped](http://codepen.io/collection/XKpoxN/) the initial front–end player/schedule interfaces, co-ordinated formative [on-air content](http://toolsday.io), and [educated](https://github.com/edouerd/radio-setup/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) folks on how to get up and running quickly on the network. Guerilla advertised the hell out of the first live broadcasts. [Archiving my mixes here.](https://soundcloud.com/morningsco)

**IBM RapidApps**
<!-- <br>
*Product Designer, Prototyper, and Researcher*
<br>
2013 — 2014 -->

An idealistic product built to empower and educate non-technical people to build applications using filetypes they knew best. I designed and utilized “spatially-concrete” interface/interaction models to simplify abstract software development concepts and led the design of RA's Rules/Logic composing interface. Spoiler alert: <span class="spoiler">The product ended up failing</span>. Read a long-form [postmortem](/posts/ra.html) on this project.

**Mobility and Catheter** (Currently Under Construction)
<!-- <br>
*Industrial Designer, Prototyper, and Researcher*
<br>
2012 — 2013 -->

With a small and independently-funded team, designed and engineered a “catheter management experience” for paraplegics and quadraplegics focusing on ease of use, cleanliness, reduction of UTI, accessibility, discreetness, and a user’s dignity. Coordinated research  efforts with the local Veteran's Association and led the design of the physical product and user experience. [Read my case study](/posts/thesis.html).
