Hey — I'm a physical–digital product designer *né* industrial designer based in New York City.

###### Currently —

1. I'm at [Tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com/) building a dazzling array of digital products for millions of creative people _and_

2. I'm tending to my experimental personal–project–studio, <a class="mornings" href="http://mornings.co/">Mornings</a> _and_

3. I'm self-organizing creative events and schooling at <a class="public-services" href="http://publicservices.co/">Public Services</a> with some good friends.

###### Previously —

4. I was at <a class="old" href="http://www.ibm.com/design/">International Business Machines</a> building many things: A (global) community radio, a <a class="old" href="/posts/pi.html">platform/tool</a> that blurred boundaries between physical space and big data, a <a class="old" href="http://www.ibm.com/design/">prototyping practice</a> non-designers/developers could understand, a democratic <a class="old" href="/posts/ra.html">product</a> doomed to fail, and the <a class="old" href="/posts/vs.html">seed of promise</a> for enabling a 100-year old company to work better, together. It was a lovely time.

Thanks for visiting and stay a while. If you want, [send me a letter](mailto:mail@edouard.us) or [tweet at me](https://twitter.com/edouerd).

###### Some work in brief —
