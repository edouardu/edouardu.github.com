**IBM Presence Insights** (Ongoing)
<!-- <br>
*Product Designer and Researcher*
<br>
2014 — 2015 -->

A product/platform which will enable people working "on the floor" (in retail, fulfillment centres, museums, airports, etc.) to get a deeper sense of the world around them. Comprised of a set of tools which enable people to weave together physical and digital experiences/systems in an intuitive and beautiful manner.

**IBM RapidApps**
<!-- <br>
*Product Designer, Prototyper, and Researcher*
<br>
2013 — 2014 -->

An idealistic product/platform built to “Democratize the process of application development”. An attempt at empowering (and educating) non-technical people to build applications to solve everyday life/business problems. RapidApps utilized “spatially-concrete” interface design metaphors so that abstract software development concepts were made easier to understand. Spoiler alert: <span class="spoiler">The product ended up failing</span>. [View the beta product](#) or read my [postmortem](/posts/ra.html).
