**IBM Presence Insights** (Ongoing)
<!-- <br>
*Product Designer and Researcher*
<br>
2014 — 2015 -->

A product/platform which will enable people working "on the floor" (in retail, fulfillment centres, museums, airports, etc.) to get a deeper sense of the world around them — PI is comprised of a set of tools people can utilize to weave together physical and digital experiences/systems in an intuitive and beautiful manner. [View the product](https://presenceinsights.ng.bluemix.net/piui/) or [read my ongoing project notes](/posts/pi.html).

**IBM RapidApps**
<!-- <br>
*Product Designer, Prototyper, and Researcher*
<br>
2013 — 2014 -->

An idealistic product/platform built to “Democratize the process of application development”. An attempt at empowering (and educating) non-technical people to build applications to solve everyday life/business problems. RapidApps utilized “spatially-concrete” interface design metaphors so that abstract software development concepts were made easier to understand. Spoiler alert: <span class="spoiler">The product ended up failing</span>. [View the beta product](https://developer.ibm.com/answers/smartspace/rapidapps/) or read my [postmortem](/posts/ra.html).

**Mobility and Catheter**
<!-- <br>
*Industrial Designer, Prototyper, and Researcher*
<br>
2012 — 2013 -->

With a small and independently-funded team, conducted research towards a holistic redesign of the “catheter management experience”, focusing on ease of use, cleanliness, reduction of UTI, accessibility, discreetness, and a user’s dignity. Led the design of the physical product and user experience. [Read my case study](/posts/thesis.html).
