      Learning Gardens is a meta-organization to support grassroots non-institutional learning, exploration, and community-building.<br><br>
      At its simplest, it is advice on how to start a reading group. At its most complex, you and your friends can achieve nirvana.

      Our Mission<br><br>

      We support learning groups in any discipline to structure their own lessons, community, and learning styles.<br><br>

      If we succeed in our mission, participating groups should feel empowered without institutional shackles.<br><br>

      <em>Community-based learning—free, with friends, using public resources—is simply a more sustainable and distributed form of learning for the 21st century.</em><br><br>

      Outside of college, there’s often a void of focused study. Peer-oriented, interest-driven study and action is better than coursework anyway. Learning Gardens seeks to support new learning endeavors, help support their ongoing structure, and share it all—decentralized, any-subject, communal study or work efforts.<br><br>
